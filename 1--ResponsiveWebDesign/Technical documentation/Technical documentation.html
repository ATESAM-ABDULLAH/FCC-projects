        <p>
          OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
            <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
            <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
            <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and 
  methods. For example: in real life, a car is an <strong>object</strong>. The car has <strong>attributes</strong>, such as weight and color, and <strong>
  methods</strong>, such as drive and brake.</p>
        <p>Attributes and methods are basically <strong>variables</strong> and <strong>
  functions</strong> that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as 
  "class members".</p>
        <p>A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it 
  works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p>

      <header>Class Methods</header>
      <article>
        <p>Methods are <strong>functions</strong> that belongs to the class.</p><p>There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:</p><ul>
  <li>Inside class definition</li>
  <li>Outside class definition</li>
  </ul><p>In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name 
  it "<code class="w3-codespan">myMethod</code>".</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You access methods just like you access attributes; by creating an object of 
  the class and using the dot syntax (<code class="w3-codespan">.</code>):</p><p>To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it 
  inside the class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the 
  name of the class, followed the scope resolution <code class="w3-codespan">::</code> operator, 
  followed by the name of the function:</p>

      <article>
        <p>A constructor in C++ is a <strong>special method</strong> that is 
  automatically called when an object of a class is created.</p><p>To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by 
  parentheses <code class="w3-codespan">()</code>:</p><h4>Constructor Parameters</h4><p>Constructors can also take parameters (just like regular functions), which can be 
  useful for setting initial values for attributes.</p><p>Just like functions, constructors can also be defined outside the class. 
  First, declare the constructor inside the class, and then define it outside of the 
  class by specifying the name of the class, followed by the scope resolution <code class="w3-codespan">::</code> 
  operator, followed by the name of the constructor (which is the same as the 
  class):</p>

      <article>
        <p>By now, you are quite familiar with the <code class="w3-codespan">public</code> keyword that appears in all of our class examples:</p><p>The <code class="w3-codespan">public</code> keyword is an <strong>access specifier.</strong> 
  Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can 
  be accessed. In the example above, the members are <code class="w3-codespan">public</code> - which means that they 
  can be accessed and modified from outside the code. </p><p>However, what if we want 
  members to be private and hidden from the outside world? </p><p>In C++, there are three access specifiers:</p><ul>
  <li><code class="w3-codespan">public</code> - members are accessible from outside the class</li>
  <li><code class="w3-codespan">private</code> - members cannot be accessed (or 
  viewed) from outside the class</li>
  <li><code class="w3-codespan">protected</code> - members cannot be accessed from 
  outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.</li>
  </ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to access private members of a class 
  using a public method inside the same class. See the next chapter (Encapsulation) 
  on how to do this.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as 
  often as you can). This will reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code. This is also the 
    main ingredient of the Encapsulation
    concept, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.</p>

      <article>
        <p>In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:</p><ul>
  <li><strong>derived class</strong> (child) - the class that inherits from another class</li>
  <li><strong>base class</strong> (parent) - the class being inherited from</li>
  </ul><p>To inherit from a class, use the <code class="w3-codespan">:</code> symbol.</p><h4>Why And When To Use "Inheritance"?</h4><p>- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.</p><p>A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from 
  another class.</p><p>A class can also be derived from more than one base class, using a <strong>comma-separated list:</strong></p><p>You learned from the <a href="#Access_Specifiers">Access Specifiers</a> chapter that there are three 
  specifiers available in C++. Until now, we have only used <code class="w3-codespan">public</code> (members of a 
  class are accessible from outside the class) and <code class="w3-codespan">private</code> (members can only be 
  accessed within the class). The third specifier, <code class="w3-codespan">protected</code>, is similar to 
  <code class="w3-codespan">private</code>, but it can also be accessed in the 
  <strong>inherited</strong> class:</p>

      <article>
        <p>Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.</p><strong>Inheritance</strong></a> lets us 
  inherit attributes and methods from another class. <strong>Polymorphism</strong> 
  uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single 
  action in different ways.</p><p>Remember from the <a href="#Inheritance">Inheritance </a>  that we use the <code class="w3-codespan">:</code> symbol to inherit from a class.</p><h4>Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?</h4>
  <p>- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.</p>
